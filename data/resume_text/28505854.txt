Managing multiple work streams and teams related to platform software development for set-top boxes. 
Interacting 
with customers,
vendors and multiple cross functional groups. 
Managing 
product development and supporting deployment of products.Â 
Evangelized and led development of new middleware solution for OTT and other 
multimedia playback on set-tops. The middleware is being
designed 
for a very responsive user experience, minimum copy transfer of 
buffers along playback/record pipelines, high performance
playback 
of multiple contents in several video windows and content security. The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from
from a mini web server.
Led 
a team for developing cutting edge platform software solution for 
set-top box for MSOs. 
The 
software has several features like
HTML5 UI with webkit/QT, home 
networking, DVR, content protection, DRM and playback on 2nd screens 
like iPads etc. 
Software is
deployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global in 
Poland and Czech republic. Worked on EOS flavor of this product 
which is going to
be deployed in some countries in Europe by end of 
this year. Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt 
resource management and
channel changes. 
Also 
worked on leading a team of developers towards development of 
software components for headless gateway
product for home networking 
with new Intel Chipsets.Â The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.
Led 
a group towards porting of Comcast RDK platform on ST Micro SoCs for 
set-tops. 
Led 
a group towards porting/development of
software for RDK platform for 
RNG150 Comcast platforms.

Worked 
on development of technologies in the field of consumer electronics.
Led 
a team of engineers towards development of BD-J stack for Blu-ray 
Players. Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system
and 
application management, led the development of other modules for the 
stack - security framework, JMF and Java TV subsystem,
interactive 
audio, graphics subsystem (based on AWT, HAVi and DVB extensions) 
and all other BDJ specific modules. Led the efforts on
all 
certifications required for BD-J ( JAVA, BD+, BD-J APIs ). 
Worked 
on supporting the product in market after shipment.
Played 
critical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware, 
the technology was later sold to a third party. Contributed tospecification group for OCAP. Worked on architecture of application 
framework, security framework and file system and some other
modules, 
architected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP - 
DSM-CC file system.
Development 
of Advanced Media Player, this media player had a Blu-ray player at 
its core and other network enhanced functionality for
video 
playback, music, photo management for local and remote content, this 
had music recommendation features 
on client device with the
help of 
remote server in cloud. Also worked on architecture for making 
closed and open source code co-exist within the same system.
Â The media player was modeled as being driven by Restful JSON APIs.

Worked 
towards development of various technologies related to interactive TV set-top boxes for different markets.
DTV4.0 
(Sheep) compact client development for Comcast on PACE Daytona Box 
on GI headend. 
Dynamic Internet Protocol Interface
(DIPI) client 
for DTV Navigator to support Inband IP data transfer to set-top via 
IPGateway. Various types of IP access options viz Force
Tuning, 
Channel tracking were developed. IPGateway development, I worked on 
basic DSM-CC session protocol implementation to
provision continuous 
feed sessions for inband pipe with the Scientific Atlanta DNCS 
(Digital Network Control System) and also
provisioning Power TV DIPI 
clients on this CFSs.
Micro 
1.0 and Micro 2.0 clients featuring Java based TVGuide, VOD, micro 
browser and TVTicker. My responsibility in this was to
develop 
Tuner, MPEG Java APIs, porting of VOD client, TVGuide-CA java layer, 
TVGuide integration, enhancement to data service and
other 
integration and bug fixes. 
Worked 
on feature of displaying MPEG I/P frames on a dynamically updated 
carousel content from a
Liberate server. 
Other 
part of my responsibility in the project was to write glue layer at 
micro JAVA virtual machine for applications using a
Multicast File 
System protocol to tune to data/video channels and I/P frames.
