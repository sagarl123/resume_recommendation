TEACHER
Profile
I am a highly qualified K-12 Vocal Music Teacher holding a BS in Music Education from Kansas State University and Sterling College. (1999) I
believe in building a solid foundation in the formative years and helping students find many different ways to experience music.I lead them to
develop 
passion in music and performance that leads them to continue in Music in Middle, High School and beyond. 
Providing multiple delivery
methods in teaching, assures each student will experience, learn and retain key music knowledge in they way that they learn best. Using Brain
Research Strategies, coupled with Multiple Intelligences, HOTS, and Explicit Instruction, I have found a way to teach students Music through all
Core areas. Music is a Universal Language. Regardless of gender or race, music looks the same on paper but is experienced in numerous ways
through Culture. I am passionate about teaching!
