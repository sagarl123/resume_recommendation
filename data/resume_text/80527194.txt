Accomplishments
To Whom It May Concern, My name is Vincent Hall, and I hate the "One-Size-Fits-All" approach to business.
When marketing doesn't feel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.
Gone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the "lone wolf" and heroically
conquer the "Corporate Ladder".
Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, "Corporate -Isolationism".
A business, whether a start-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with its
audience.
My interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me "The only road to success is the one you build through work and
creativity".
This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand human behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics
behind product positioning.
What about the product makes it appealing.
How can a business increase delivery efficiency.
How does a business drive up profit margins while driving down production costs? In conclusion, between my experience in accounting,
marketing research, marketing strategy, product positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key
things.
First, individual's desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.
It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds or less.
Second, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.
In other words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options to every customer.
It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will assist in your company's
profitability in product positioning.
