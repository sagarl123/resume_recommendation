LEAD CHEF & FOOD TRUCK MANAGER
Summary
At the Culinary Institute of America, I was taught and mentored by an expert team of world renowned chefs and professors with outstanding
industry and education credentials. I gained extensive exposure and experience through the advanced culinary curriculum that is only offered at
CIA. My education went beyond memorizing and executing foods, cooking techniques and recipes - I learned how to analyze foods, how to adapt
them, and most important ... how to get creative with them. I am well trained in both classic and contemporary culinary methods and techniques
and developed a strong understanding of how to prepare a wide variety of global cuisines, as well as, wine & beer pairing.
I have had the opportunity to work with famed Chef Larry Forgione "The Godfather of American Cuisine" (father of Iron Chef Marc Forgione)
Learning the true practice of sourcing local ingredients into the restaurant known as farm-to-table cooking. I gained extensive hands-on experience
in CIA professional kitchens and bakeshops, and in their award-winning student-staffed restaurants (including the American Bounty Restaurant,
and Ristorante Caterina de' Medici, St. Andrews Restaurant). I gained both back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house experience under the
guidance of the expert faculty and through a 5 month externship at Walt Disney World's 3rd signature premier restaurant "Artist Point" in Orlando,
Florida at the Wilderness Lodge in Magic Kingdom. Additionally, I gained solid professional experience at Cattail Creek Country club in
Maryland, running the private catering businesses.
