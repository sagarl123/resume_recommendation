Accomplishments
Business Development: 
Successfully grew current business by increasing sales of Jersey Mike's over 30% since becoming the General
Manager 14 months ago.
3rd place - 2013 NC Fire on the Rock - Team Canyons Cross-state competition of chefs/sous' from different restaurants on a cook off
containing secret North Carolina local ingredients. We had 8 hours to complete a 4 course meal enough for 150 guests. This was a great
personal experience.
I have worked full-time since I was 14.5 years old. Throughout college, I worked 40 hours weekly in the kitchen not including the 20 hours
average per week I would also bartend. I am an extremely hard worker and will get any job done. Working for world renown Executive
Chefs really inspired me to become as focused and determined as I am.

Worked 40 hours weekly in the kitchen as well as 20 hours weekly behind the bar.
Ensured daily activites were being upheld, had responsiblity over staff, food specials, etc.
I worked the bar on busy nights and occasional day shifts on weekends.
This was the most popular college bar in town with Thursday-Sunday being very busy. Noisy, busy, high-paced environment in which I
excel in.
I absolutely loved it! Reason for leaving was I was moving to Melbourne, Australia!.
