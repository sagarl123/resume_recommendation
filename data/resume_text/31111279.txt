MANAGER, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE
Professional Summary
Highly motivated and driven Manager of the Project Management Office (PMO) . Currently seeking potential opportunities to continue to help
other organizations realize and reap benefits of formal PMO methodology. Passionate about PMO engagement in health care, as I have watched
over 17 years of what was once lacking in this industry, take hold and prove its value and worth. I have had the pleasure and benefit of watching
three organizations grow and blossom their teams with training and growth and development of a methodology that fits the culture of each
organization.
