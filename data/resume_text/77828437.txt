Sponsored by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) as a part of advance innovative energy
solutions Reviewed the existing literature on the different pyrolysis models used to characterize biomass Performed heating experiments
using a DSC-TGA to study the pyrolysis of BioBlock Using TGA, calculated the kinetic parameters like activation energy and rate constant
from the obtained mass v/s temperature and derivative of mass loss v/s temperature curves Determined the heat of pyrolysis and specific
heat using the heat flow v/s temperature and derivative of heat flow v/s temperature curve obtained from the DSC Finally, created a
decomposition model based on the experimental results Solving Non-Linear Euler Equation for Gas Dynamics using CFD tools, November
2014 Â​ December 2014 Solution for the Euler equation for Gas Dynamics was obtained using First Order Lax Friedrich Scheme, Runge
Â​ Kutta Fourth Order Â​ TVD Scheme and Lax Wendroff Method Fundamental properties of the schemes were compared and discussed
in detail Solution obtained by each numerical method was presented along with a conclusion on which of the 3 methods was more accurate
Numerical solution to the Prandtl-Glauert equation for inviscid, non-heat conducting perfect gas free flow, September 2014 Â​ October
2014 In this project, the Wave Equation is solved using two different numerical methods, namely Successive Over- Relaxation and
Alternating Direction Grid generation is discussed in detail and results obtained using analytical as well as numerical methods were compared
FBG Sensors in Oil/Gas Permanent Downhole Measurement Applications, January 2014 Â​ May 2014 Analyzed how FBG Sensors are
used for Permanent Downhole Measurement Applications Studied the sensing mechanism of FBG Sensors Summarized the/ findings in the
form of report and power point presentation Closed-Ended Oscillating Heat Pipe, October 2011 Presented a seminar on Closed-Ended
Oscillating Heat Pipe as a part of coursework Discussed in detail the basic concepts, principle of operation, advantages, limitations and
