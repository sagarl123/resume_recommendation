Accomplishments
In my time with my current position, I have advanced very quickly and have been recognized for the many goals and achievements that the
property has met. I have been nominated at many different times throughout my 3 years in Marketing and led our property to be nominated for
Property of the Year. In 2015, our property succeeded with a 3.7% increase in NOI over 2014 and 2016 is predicted to exceed 2015.Â 
I am very experienced with studying the market and making that dependent on optimizing rents. Since 2014, I have aided in helping to increased
our property's occupied rent by over $100 and that is continuing to rise.Â
