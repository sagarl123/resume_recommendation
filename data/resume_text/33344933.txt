Additional Information
Growing up in Indonesia as the son of missionaries, I attended Central Java Inter-Mission School (now, Mountainview International Christian
School) in Salatiga. 
My formative educational experience happened under the guidance of teachers and an institution that had an abiding faith in
God and the the transformational power of Jesus Christ. 
I would deeply appreciate the opportunity to allow my faith in the revolutionary power of
the cross to inform and infuse all aspect of my teaching practice. 
I seek to emulate the fine example made manifest in the lives of the teacher that
taught me at CJIMS. 
I believe this is the kind of ministry that God has interwoven into the fibers of my very being.
