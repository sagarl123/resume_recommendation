components). Updating the OAM, MES, and OEE portals daily with information from the chief technician. Gathering quotes and product
specifications for my two assigned projects, red-lining P&IDs in preparation for changes within the plant, and assisting with any jobs that my
supervisor needs done. Lead any Management of Change meeting regarding my projects. Projects are as follows: 
-Replacing an automatic valve
with a control valve on a condensate tank; adding a differential pressure transmitter to control the tank level; installing an orifice plate in the pipe to
control the flow into the tank. Responsibilities included obtaining bids for mechanical labor, electrical and instrumentation labor, and DCS
configuration and quotes for instrumentation. The scope of the project was $50,000. 
- Installing an RF Capacitance probe on an existing sight
glass on a holding tank; replacing a chemical hose with a 316L stainless steel pipe and installing a control valve in the pipe to control the interface
level within the sight glass. Responsibilities included obtaining bids for mechanical labor, electrical and instrumentation labor, and DCS
