During my Preceptorship Project (needs
assessment and literary review phase) I conducted focus groups regarding underutilization of health education services in the community served by
the Delta Area Health Education Center in Phillips County Arkansas. The overarching goal was to utilize focus group data findings to help the
Delta AHEC develop a plan of action for quality/effective health education services delivery. 
The project developed into my Capstone Project in
which I developed a Services Promotion Plan to help address, and evaluate the barriers in health education services provided by the Delta AHEC,
and also help enhance community based participation by minority residents.

organizations collaborate to meet health goals of the state.
