Personal Information
Euler-Mascheroni constant A transcendental number is a number (possibly a complex number) which is not algebraic-that is, it is not a root of a
non-constant polynomial equation with rational coefficients. 
Originally created by Leonhard Euler in his paper, titled De Progressionibus harmonicis
observationes 
in 1735, represented by the Greek letter Gamma, *, Euler valued * at 
.5772. 
Mathematicians for 278 years have not been able to
prove the Euler-Mascheroni constant is transcendental. 
I developed an infinite sum series while also making use of the Taylor Polynomial, proving
the Euler-Mascheroni constant is a transcendental number. Fields Medal candidate. Nobel Laureate candidate for work in Physics. The
