CONSULTANT
Profile
Results driven and team oriented reservoir engineer with extensive experience in reservoir management, enhanced oil recovery, reserve evaluation,
integrated reservoir modeling, compositional simulation, economic analysis, geomechanics, and project management, looking to utilize his diverse
analytical and research skills in a challenging role. Fluent in English and French. Has experience working with professionals of different technical
and cultural backgrounds.
Skills
Pressure and rate transient analyses
Decline curve analysis (Fekete Harmony)
Volumetrics and material balance
Economic analysis (ARIES)
Knowledge in SEC reserves estimation
concepts
Project management
Reservoir management
History-matching and production forecast
Compositional and black oil simulation
Enhance oil recovery (Waterflooding, CO2 injection, WAG, and polymer flood).
Knowledgeable in unconventional resourse evaluation and modeling of fractured
systems.
Good understanding of reservoir geology and depositional system fundamentals
Geochemical modeling
Reservoir geomechanics
Good understanding of log and core analyses
Accomplishments
Strategic development
Contributed in negotiations between operators and CO2 suppliers to evaluate the technical and economic viability of CO2 enhanced
recovery in three Illinois Basin oil fields. This will result to potential increase in profit oil by about half a million barrels.
Project Management
By being the Principal investigator for a US Department of Energy project my employer gained an award of $1,000,900.
Demonstrated technical and managerial leadership by putting together a team of geoscientists and engineers to complete projects on time
and within budget thus saving client about $2 million in capital and operational cost.
Directed and mentored interns who later landed permanent positions as a result of my efforts.
Trained engineering staff on how to use and troubleshoot Landmark Nexus and Eclipse commercial simulators and so doing increased
efficiency of the group by 15%.
Project coordination and outreach
Led a team of three researchers to three universities in Cameroon to donate computers and provide training in ArcGIS, MS Excel and MS
Access to geoscience graduate students and staff, in March 2014.
Appointments and awards
Appointed by dean of Graduate School to serve as student representative of the graduate council at the University of South Florida from
2007 to 2009, to advice the dean on general policies and procedures on matters related to graduate education and research.
Received the European Union- Greenhouse-gas Removal Apprenticeship and Student Program (EU- GRASP) post-doctoral research
scholarship from 2009 to 2010.
