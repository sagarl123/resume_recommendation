TIMESHARE SALES
Summary
I am extremely confident that my skills, mentorship, education and experience will set me apart from the rest. Many would describe my character
as someone who is always dedicated to the project at hand and willing to go the extra mile. I've managed large projects and provided meticulous
attention to organizational processes and correct flaws when/if they occur.
I am searching for a lucrative career in Sales as I have embodied the skill to connect with people, ask the right questions and find the need and
desire for the product or property. Â 
Currently living in Brickell and originally from NYC. Searching for a great company where I can contribute exceptional sales, work ethics,
creativity and leadership.Â
