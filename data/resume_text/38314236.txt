ENGINEERING SUPERVISOR
Summary
I am a Mechanical Engineer with 8 years of product design experience with an emphasis on non-metallic materials used in oil field-related
equipment, as well as a year in HVAC experience. 
Proficient in CAD and FEA software, I am also experienced with ISO document control
processes and ASTM/API/NORSOK requirements. My leadership skills are exemplified by my dedication, strong work ethic, and ability to
motivate colleagues through example. I am seeking a position with an industry-leading manufacturing and design corporation, and I believe my
work experience and management skills render me an excellent candidate for this position.
