I graduated high school, didn't expand my education through school but had a lot of hands on training. I learned all my cooking skills through
watching a Chef and listening to what he said. As I grew in the industry my cooking skills became more fine tuned. I challenged myself to create
new menu ideas and searched for more ways to be a better Chef.
Housekeeping for me started when I was young, I learned to clean the kitchen, bathroom, dust, dishes, laundry and iron. I have worked in private
homes, commercial businesses, and for myself.\\\\
