GRAPHIC DESIGNER
Summary
A graphic designer, who is creative and detail-oriented; who thinks a lot, but wants to make things clear and simple. "Simple without loss of
information," is my style. "Pay attention and be accurate to each pixel" is the phrase I will always keep in mind during my design career. Right now
I'm looking for a suitable position in a company that has a team of pleasant, experienced designers and a working environment, which allows
people to grow and succeed.
