Accomplishments
Assisted in the centralization of accounting to the Bloomington-Normal corporate office.
Â 
When multiple co-workers were out of the office I covered all of the PZ01 forms that came into the mail box processing over 99% of them and
keeping the team from falling behind on them for that day receiving an "On the Spot" award for my accomplishment.
Â 
I hold the record for the most Premium Fund Account reviews to be done in 1 day on my team completing 16 reviews in 1 day while still
maintaining a quality score of 97%.
Â 
Came up with multiple ideas to make processes on our team more efficient for example sometimes we would get questions about what review
materials we have received and what we still need from agents and we would have to go pull the file and locate it in the file room every time but
instead I suggested we all get read only access to the tool we use to check in materials to be able to see on demand what they are missing and
what we still need so no longer did we need to go track down files to complete this task.

I worked on two different teams during my employment at State Farm, one was Suspense and the other was Premium Fund Account Review.
Â 
Suspense: (2012-2014)
Processed credit card refunds.
Processed PZ01 forms that would be requested mainly from the fire division to change policy information.
Worked Control D listings to clear items that didn't match off via journal entries in Oracle.
Worked Agent returns where retired or working agents owed State Farm money and we had to set up payment plans or collect on that
money and then clear the listing.
Worked employee returns where employees would write bad checks at company stores or mail rooms for stamps or postage and we would
have to contact those employees and collect from them.
Took phone calls and provided remarkable customer service to everyone that called in with a question and went out of my way to try to
provide an answer to each caller even if it wasn't in my expertise I would try to get them to someone directly to get there question answered
instead of just transferring them along as I try my best to make every call remarkable.
Had to complete "FARs" (Financial account reconciliations) on a monthly basis to make sure all the accounts you were responsible for
balanced out at the end of every month via lotus notes program.
Premium Fund Account Review: (2014-2016)
Worked material check in where you would need to collect mail as well as faxes and check in the materials received from agents into the
system and then file there folders to be reviewed.
Processed agent premium fund account reviews on a daily basis for compliance problems and making sure everything they did in the office
was done correctly and timely.
Analyzed bank statements, quicken bank registers and reconciliations as well as manual copies, reviewed history of altered money reports
and deposit to activity ratios to make sure everything matched up and that there was no money missing.
Made sure nobody was stealing in the agent offices and if there were any discrepancies informed the agent about them.Â 
Assisted agents in finding or fixing reconciliation errors or balancing issues.
Took phone calls on a daily basis providing remarkable customer service.
