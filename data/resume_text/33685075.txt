Engineer responsible for process development and improvement at Alcon's Class II/III medical device manufacturing site.
Designed, built, validated, and implemented the next generation automated milling machines for use in AcrySof Single-Piece IOL
manufacturing.
Increased output in AcrySof Single-Piece IOL milling by more than 25% while not impacting quality through an iterative process of adjusting
key parameters and verifying impact on cycle time and product quality.
Designed, built, tested, and validated the prototype packaging and labeling workstation. Evaluated prototype for ergonomics and work flow
with the help of production personnel. Modified the design accordingly and built, and validating the remaining 23 workstations. Validated
improvements to the software after initial release. The resultant stations prevent packaging failures from getting out into the field.
Developed and analyzed proof of concept models to evaluate manufacturing improvements using Pro/E prior to implementation.
Set priorities, provided direction, and supervision to one direct report
