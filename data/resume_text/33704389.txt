TEACHER
Summary
My applied experience in elementary level teaching combined with my B.A in History/Music as well Alt. Certification (K-5), makes me a worthy
contender for a teacher position at your school .Utilizing my skills and expertise, I am eager to become a key member of your team. As specified in
the enclosed resume, I offer you the following attributes in order to contribute to your ongoing success: * Well versed in assisting children in build
social, cognitive, emotional, and physical skills. * Adept at providing a stimulating conducive classroom environment. * Special talent for utilizing
the highest quality teaching resources and classroom materials. It is paramount that in order to become the best teacher, good interaction with the
students is essential - aside from imparting good knowledge. The expectation of what the students think and how they would think in a particular
state of affairs is equally important in my point of view. In addition, I apply an innovative teaching approach which includes the incorporation of
21st century skill sets that will prepare my students to compete with other students both nationally and internationally. 
Of all my strengths, I take
extreme pride in the patience and dedication required to meet the needs of children from socially and culturally diverse backgrounds. My insight
not only comes from my years in the classroom as a teacher, but also from my years a pupil. Having lived abroad for many of my formative years,
as well as some after college, I understand the delicate balance that is needed to make learning inclusive to all. CERTIFIED ELEMENTARY
