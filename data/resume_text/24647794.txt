Accomplishments
IEEE Robot Competition 
Systems Design (CAPSTONE) 
Spring 2013 - spring 2014
 
Collaborated with a team of 4 engineering
students in the design and implementation of an autonomous robot that has to detect an oil rig on "fire", select and transport a specific tool in
order to extinguish the fire Lead the mechanical design of the robot; both chassis and robotic arm parts with 3-D printing technology and
SolidWorks software.
Acquired experience with the mechanical shop equipment and lab instruments while producing mechanical components and implementing
and assembling electrical circuits.
Acquired experience using the product development life cycle and risk assessment.
Gained experience in the integration of the hardware and software subsystems and the testing process of the design.
Competed in the 2014 IEEE Region V robotics competition.
Spectrum Analyzer 
Real Time Signal Processing 
Fall 2013 Programmed a C6713 DSK board and implemented a digital Spectrum
Analyzer.
The program was written using Code Composer studio and the UI was developed in Visual Basics Used the Software development
lifecycle to develop the software of the system.
Built the UI using Visual Basics.NET.
Guitar Tuner 
Digital Signal Processing 
Spring 2013 Â· Engineered a guitar tuner implemented by programming a C6713 DSK board.
Designed analog filters and digital filters to remove noise in an audio file using algorithms developed with Matlab and Simulink.
Laser Project 
Computer Systems 
Spring 2013 Â· Created a compact computer system that controls and animates letters on a wall.
Implemented the hardware schematics developed in assembly language on a MC68HC11 microprocessor.
Acquired much experience in troubleshooting the system using a logic analyzer and oscilloscope.
