CHEF DE CUISINE
Executive Profile
My culinary background started with a simple cooking class in high school that grew into a love for all things food. Â I went to Le Cordon Bleu
culinary school where I developed a solid foundation in french cuisine, techniques and flavours. After graduating I spent the winter in southern Italy
training under Michelin star Chef Richard Titi. This cultivated my passion for pasta, which has continued ever since. Most recently I have been
running the kitchen for Chef Scott Howard at Citizen in Beverly Hills. Â
