PRODUCTION DESIGNER
Summary
Specializing in Art Department I have had many different opportunities, as well as many different positions. I love working with a team and
collaborating, though I can work alone and am happy to do what is asked. I am not concerned with receiving a position of power, I listen to
instructions very intently. However if the situation called for it I can easily give instruction in a polite and respectful manner. I am also very skilled
with almost all power tools, safety laws, and am a skilled teacher if the occasion calls for it. Though I enjoy the work in art department I am
capable of filling any position if need be. I am very passionate about Film and the entertainment industry and will always be willing to help in any
way I can.
Highlights
Work well with others and under pressure. Quick learner and yearns to excel. Keeps busy and takes
initiative with things within my department. I am a great delegator when it comes to leading a team,
however I am also very good at following instructions and the chain of command. Sketching and hand
drafting. Proficient in MS Word & Powerpoint. Experienced in Photoshop, Aftereffects, Avid Media, and
Google Sketchup.
Accomplishments
I have only been working in the industry for 3 years yet I already have 6 going on 7 projects listed on IMDB.
I edited a screenplay, turned 50 pages of Dialogue into 127 pages of a well plotted Romance Comedy and full length feature.
I have brought many people together and helped to create work opportunities for the people I believe in and that I know will do the job well.
