Summary
Dynamic event planner and communications professional looking for the anti-desk job. My main passions in life are travel, food, and creating
events and experiences, specifically around food. I have lived all over the US and in multiple countries. I have worked in multiple restaurants,
although it is not reflected on my resume. I would be happy to send a list of the places I've worked. I spent six years working with chefs and
authors in cookbook publishing world in NYC (Cooking with Italian Grandmothers (IACP and IPPY winner), Afield (James Beard Nominated),
Off the Menu, Primal Cuts, Made in America). I also worked for JustFood.org under Jessica Gaffney (Former Director of Marketing on multiple
events). I planned The Butcher's Guild conference in Napa. I created a workshop in Chicago called Sustainable:: Cities at a cooking school, as
part of the Off the Menu book tour. I have been responsible for garnering press and sponsorship/partnerships for cookbooks and events.
