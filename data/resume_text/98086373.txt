PUBLIC RELATIONS MANAGER
Summary
A growing professional who blends academic training in recreation and sports management with hands on experience in operations,
communications, media, and public relations. With a diverse background in the sports and event industry, I have gained an appreciation of what it
means to work hard, manage time and roll with the punches. As a creative and logical hybrid, I tackle every opportunity with enthusiasm and
determination and am always looking for a chance to learn.
