Description: The Legacy Data Store (LDS) as a logical part of the EDW consists of 12 tables.
It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.
The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on
S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.
The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.
Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.
A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.
Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.
Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.
The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.
