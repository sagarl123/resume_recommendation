After many years of successfully managing the budget/forecast process of a 100 million dollar national multi-state non-profit, I was asked to lead
the areas of gift processing, banking and risk management areas. These segments of our national institution were fragmented and in much need of
leadership.
Gift Processing - led the charge to streamline the overall process from switching our banking relationship to a financial institution that best
suited our needs; working with our new caging partner and our technology area to implement a check processing application across our
network in an effort to create a more efficient work flow.
Risk Management - working with the risk manager, we streamlined our allocation process through the creation of an insurance portal. This
application created a clearer view of what each department head was incurring in each segment of insurance. We also were successful for in
aligning our insurance policies on our fiscal year cycle.
Banking - Our focus has been on consolidating our banking relationships. The role out of an online invoicing system and the set up of a
procurement card program allowed us to close 35 bank accounts around the country.
