Our team has created an application for Turkish Patent and Trademark Office using MatLab, C#, SQL and HTML.
My responsibilities within that team was:.
Developed the FAQ and Support part of the web site.
Researched various studies and recommended alternate algorithms for Image processing to increase accuracy and speed.
Tested and documented prototypes and standard products.
Maintained positive work atmosphere by building relationships with co-workers, customers, clients and management.
PROJECTS Question Answering System: As the sole resource on this project created a windows application with Phyton for COVID-19
related questions using BERT and ELMO language models.
The Frameworks were Pandas, Tensorflow, NLTK.
Data Visualization Tool: The objective of this project was to analyze communication structures, employee relationships and suspicious
transactions by designing and implementing a data visualization tool.
The dataset included the VAST Challenge 2019 dataset with over 100,000+ data.The Frameworks were Flask, Pandas and the Language was Phyton.
My responsibilities were data cleansing and data categorization.
From the data visualization Leadership was able to get insight in the growth, sales, costs and make decisions towards better performance.
Pre-Assess Melanoma: The objective of the project was to create a system that could pre-assess malignant melanoma using Matlab
Language and image processing algorithms.
The system was trained with the images of malignant and healthy images.
My responsibilities included all development, testing and training.
The User Interface was the responsibility of other team member.
This system enabled the users to seek healthcare at earlier stages of melanoma.
