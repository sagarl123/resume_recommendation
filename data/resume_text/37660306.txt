After my husband's death, I wished to participate in some creative work that was not utilizing flowers as my mediumÂ of design.
I enjoyed and did very well with my study and certification in mixology.
It was fun and as a natural educator, I was able to help younger students and to give them confidence.
I have not pursued a position as I became a full time guest teacher with Clark County School District. I resigned as a guest teacher on
10/10/2015.Â  At this time anything is possible.Â  I am positive, helpful and love to be involved in the social world.
