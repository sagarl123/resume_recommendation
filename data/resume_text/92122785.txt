BANQUET CHEF
Professional Summary
To whom it may concern: Please accept this letter as my application for the position of executive chef. I am an ambitious and well rounded chef
who is able to lead from the front by setting, following and delivering the highest culinary standards. I possess a passion for excellence, and always
strive hard to im- prove standards and guest satisfaction. My goal as executive chef is to provide the club members with an experience that
exceeds there expectations. I believe that is accomplished by using the highest quality food product keeping within the food budget and assembling
the best possible culinary brigade to meet the members needs. I standardize my recipes to maintain consistency and always demonstrate what is
ex- pected for each dish concerning portion size, proper cooking techniques, and presentation. My management style is fair, firm, and friendly but
with high expectations, also I consider my self to be proactive in running the kitchen. I delegate people according to their strengths, but rotate them
seasonally to different stations to help them in their professional development and increas- ing flexibility in the kitchen staff. I train the wait staff on
the menu by letting them sample the menu items, and listen to their feed back. I am flexible with special dietary requests from members. I am glad
to make adjustments for health conscious members, or those with specific dietary needs. I am visible to the members in the dinning room so that I
am able to receive their feed back on the menu. Over the years I had the pleasure of working with some of the best chefs in the country which has
enabled me to have a board knowledge of different types of cuisines and keeping up with trends.
