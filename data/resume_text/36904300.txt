In this small, family owned business there are a lot of hats to be worn. And with just 4 employees to run this store; a store manager, two
salespeople and our jeweler, this is not just a sales job.
I provided courteous and prompt service by greeting & welcoming customers, assisting them in locating what they're looking for and provided
excellent afterÂ​sales service by sending out thank you letters, birthday & anniversary reminders and followÂ​up calls to check in and see how
everything is going with their purchases.
I keep the behind the scenes of the store running smoothly by ordering all supplies; jewelry boxes, gift bags, watch batteries and all office and
shipping supplies. I assisted in ordering new merchandise for the store, picking new styles and creating new styles through our custom jewelry
design. I used POS data entry for all sales, customer contact information, research of transaction history and entering all inventory into the store
data base. I used Outlook for all email correspondence, Microsoft Word for all documents, Excel spreadsheet for inventory of certain items and
QuickBooks for payments. Other office functions included shipping via UPS, FedEx and USPS, scanning of documents, photo documentation for
appraisals, making photocopies, sending faxes and filing of paperwork, invoices and all vendor files. Create new vendor files and purge year end to
storage for safe keeping. I answered multiÂ​line telephone system, took messages, return calls and transfer appropriate calls to the owner.
