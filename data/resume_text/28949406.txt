ASSISTANT MANAGER/ SALES AND RELOCATION SPECIALIST
Summary
I have been working professionally in the field of multi-family housing communities for over two years. My day to day duties are in sales and
relocation assistance, taking tours, helping with resident and client issues, many administrative and office tasks, and processing of monies, following
up with leads, scheduling vendors for maintenance issues, ordering supplies, data collection and weekly reports for our owners, and appointment
setting. I learn and adapt easily, work well with others and am efficient and accurate in my work.
I received my B.S. in Appropriate Technology from Appalachian State University in 2012 and am currently completing a second degree part time
online, a B.S.B.E. in Information Technology with East Carolina University.
