Personal Information
I grew up on a farm in a small town of Superior, Pennsylvania. My early influences were all centered on food. My grandparents grew and sold
their own vegetables and meats. 
Dennis Turkey Farm 
was known for its customer satisfaction and â€˜clean farm' practices. I learned about
environmental stewardship from grandparents that farmed holistically. I fondly remember working with Grandpa Dennis, plucking turkey feathers
and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in
her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called 
Glisans
 .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for
savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very
creative, positive, warm, personable with strong attention to detail and management skills. I pride myselfon quality of work with a strong work
ethic. I pride myself on high customer satisfaction and client retention. I am a true leader and a fantastic administrator and teacher.
